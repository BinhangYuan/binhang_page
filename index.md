# About Me  

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I am leading the [Relaxed System Lab](https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab). I am recruiting PhD students to work on research topics, including machine learning for data management and distributed/decentralized machine learning systems; please contact me by email with your latest resume if you are interested in joining us.

Before Joining HKUST I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Dr. [Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/).
I accomplished my Ph.D. program in Computer Science Department at Rice University. My adviser was [Dr. Chris Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/) and I was co-advised by [Dr. Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/) for my [Ph.D. thesis](publications/Thesis.pdf). I got my master degree from Computer Science Department at Rice University, supervised by [Dr. Ron Goldman](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~rng/), and bachelor degree from Computer Science Department at Fudan University guided by  [Dr. Bo Yan](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/boyan/in-english/) for research.

# Research Interests

My main research focuses are data management for machine learning and distributed/decentralized machine learning systems. Concretely, I build systems to support giant foundation models over distributed and decentralized environments.

# Hobbies

Most of my spare time (if there is any) is spent on football. I am a big fan of Liverpool. As Klopp once said, "98% of football is about dealing with failure and still being able to smile and find joy in the game the next day.", which is also true for research, I believe.
