# About Me  

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computer Science Department, ETH Zurich under the supervision of Dr. [Ce Zhang](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/members/ce-zhang.html).
I accomplished my Ph.D. program in Computer Science Department Rice University. My adviser is [Dr. Chris Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/) and co-advised by [Dr. Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/) for my [Ph.D. thesis](publications/Thesis.pdf). I got my master degree from Computer Science Department Rice University supervised by [Dr. Ron Goldman](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~rng/), and bachelor degree from Computer Science Department Fudan University guided by  [Dr. Bo Yan](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/boyan/in-english/) for research. 


# Research Interests

My main research focuses are distributed machine learning algorithms and systems: in algorithm level, I study how to customize communication schema for model synchronization based on current machine learning systems, e.g., PyTorch; in system level, I study how to deploy the training procedure of large scale machine learning models on distributed database systems.

On the other hand, I am also interested in building data mining/machine learning applications (especially time series) in fields such as wind turbine manufacturing, cardiovascular medicine, and geotechnics.

# Hobbies

Most of my spare time (if there is any for a graduate student) is spent on soccer. I am a big fan of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jurgen Klopp. I support Juventus, Liverpool and Shanghai SIPG. As Klopp once said, "98% of football is about dealing with failure and still being able to smile and find joy in the game the next day.", which is also true for research, I believe.
