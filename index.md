## About Me  

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science Department Rice University. My adviser is [Dr. Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/) and co-advised by [Dr. Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/) for my Ph.D. thesis. 

I got my master degree from Computer Science Department Rice University supervised by [Dr. Goldman](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~rng/), and bachelor degree from Computer Science Department Fudan University guided by  [Dr. Yan](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/boyan/in-english/) for research. 


## Research Interests

My main research focuses are distributed machine learning algorithms and systems: in algorithm level, I study how to customize communication schema for model synchronization based on current machine learning systems, e.g., PyTorch; in system level, I study how to deploy the training procedure of large scale machine learning models on distributed database systems.

On the other hand, I am also interested in building data mining/machine learning applications (especially time series) in fields such as wind turbine manufacturing, cardiovascular medicine, and geotechnics.


## Hobbies

Most of my spare time (if there is any for a graduate student) is spent on soccer. I am a big fan of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jordan Henderson, and Givanildo Vieira de Sousa (known as Hulk). I support Juventus, Liverpool and Shanghai SIPG.
